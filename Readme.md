# Lab 4: Create a 3D viewer

# Part 1: Create a 3d model

## Due date: Thurs. 2/30

As usual, 1 point extra credit will be awarded for completed assignment or pull request fixing error before Sat. 2/25.

Extra credit will also be given for opening and especially answering issues on the original repository.

## Task

Create and render a 3d model. Make the necessary changes in your vertices array, your shaders, and the vertex attribute commands. In addition, make your model continuously rotate (slowly) around the **y-axis**.

## Submit

Your pull request should contain the modified code and a clip of the rendered animation (like last time).

# Part 2: Create a viewer.

## Due date: Thurs. 3/2

## Task

Create appropriate view and projection matrices to position and clip your model. Link to keyboard callbacks so that pressing an arrow key moves the "camera" in the appropriate direction. 

## Submit

In addition to looking at your code, I will build your code on the test machine and test the arrow navigation.
